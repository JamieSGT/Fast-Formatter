#Setting up a button

#Physical Connection

To connect a button to a Raspberry Pi, you will need to connect the wires to the GPIO pins that are on the board. In the diagram bellow, you can see where to connect the two wires. **It's important that the buttons wires go exactly where the diagram shows.** If the button doesn't work, try switching the wires.
